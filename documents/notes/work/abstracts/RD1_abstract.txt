Single-molecule localisation microscopy (SMLM) separates fluorophore emissions in time to create a tenfold increase in spatial resolution along all three axes.
However, long acquisition times make live-cell imaging difficult.
These can only be shortened by acquiring 'high-density' data, which increases the risk of generating artificial structures in the final image â€“ a risk that is further increased when imaging in three dimensions.
The Haar Wavelet Kernel software (HAWK) is designed to remove artefacts during high-density imaging, and we have used the technology to develop a HAWK Method of Assessment (HAWKMAN) for SMLM images.
We have also been running evaluations of HAWK's propensity for ensuring effective artefact removal from a wide variety of 3D datasets.
Lastly, because methods for obtaining 3D images using SMLM usually result in relatively reduced axial resolution we have employed the machine learning-based methodology of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to ameliorate the axial resolution of SMLM images by training the network to assume structure isotropy.
