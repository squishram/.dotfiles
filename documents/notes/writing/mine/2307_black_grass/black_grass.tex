\poemtitle{Black Grass}

\begin{poem}

  \begin{stanza}
    waking caked in gristly sweat, you remember \verseline
    crawling out of the sea, from the wet \verseline
    crawling after something better? \verseline
    and suddenly feeling so old: \verseline
    you'd better have a nice cold \verseline
    glass of water.
  \end{stanza}

  \begin{stanza}
    cold gushing from the faucet \verseline
    darker than it's ever been \verseline
    water tasting like hot toddy -- \verseline
    drink it down, for you must clean \verseline
    the tap water with your body
  \end{stanza}

  \begin{stanza}
    something for your aching limbs: \verseline
    fill the black up to the rim, \verseline
    remember not to throw out the baby \verseline
    and please don't forget to wash \verseline
    the bathwater with your body
  \end{stanza}

  \begin{stanza}
    the wolf is here now, at the door \verseline
    black shit dripping from its maw \verseline
    the sea rearing up behind him \verseline
    crashing \& roaring like thunder \verseline
    he's come for his dues, come to drag \verseline
    your children back down under
  \end{stanza}

  \begin{stanza}
    running upstairs, you slip straight back \verseline
    on black oozing through the floorboards: \verseline
    thick and dark, treacle and tar, \verseline
    and you know when you're beaten \verseline
    held down by shit spent, and shit eaten \verseline
    and the wolf is upon you
  \end{stanza}

  \begin{stanza}
    lie back and think of England \verseline
    while the black drips into your mouth \verseline
    think green and roses, Thames and fog; \verseline
    think of when we worked the land harder \verseline
    and smile to yourself: \verseline
    someone will come and clean it up \verseline
    as someone always does
  \end{stanza}

  \begin{stanza}
    or maybe they can have it all? all twenty percent. \verseline
    twenty percent -- yes that seems \verseline
    good enough, seems to be in order: \verseline
    twenty percent of slow rivers and fast seas \verseline
    of black grass and orange water.
  \end{stanza}

\end{poem}
