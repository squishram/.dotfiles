I suppose I'm meant to ask how this finds you?
um
hopefully
in pools of the enclosed, of which I've deprived you
my only letter to you, and it's a stinking apology
on the 43 bus so you'll forgive the poor quality

Sorry, D. E. McVickers, I just couldn't sleep,
so chuffed was I with this, a perfect scene:
that I rescued your sunglasses! only didn't succeed
without abducting your god damn, motherfucking sertraline.
it's unfathomably crap - a trip so effervescent
that you're coming down from without antidepressants.

& also, a huge thank-you
for writing to my partner
it can't have been easy
but I think it was needed -
so thank you.
oh how it became such a tiresome disaster,
I hope for more interesting letters hereafter.

love, squish

P.S.
what are you still doing reading this trite
throw it away you bleeding-heart shite
throw it away
throw it away
for God's sake throw it away
crumple it up and throw it away
what if someone found it?
silly idiot.
