Hiya mate,

I'd like to qualify all of this by saying I have never, ever, in my LIFE written a letter that wasn't a desperate plea for employment; we are right through the looking-glass in the wardrobe down the wormhole under the stairs here baby, what on Earth is happening, will the last line be 'it was all a dream'? I will (probably spend this whole thing) explain(ing) why I want us writing letters, and then you can decide for yourself if it is, in fact, a completely mental waste of everyone's time.

So, the flashes of creativity that people talk and write about are pure mythology to me, but I've always found it quite painful that they're not mythological at all.
Oh, you improvised Moonlight Sonata after losing your hearing?
You invented our best current theory about the chemical structure of all aromatic compounds because you had a dream about a snake noshing itself off? REALLY?
You made a vow never to write novels and only stick to short stories but oh, okay, okay FINE, JUST this once, you've got an idea about Lincoln's son trapped in purgatory, for which you MAY be willing to break open the dam YOU BUILT YOURSELF to hold back your voluptuous creative juices?
etc. And those are just the ones I can remember right now! Bastards.
Either people aren't willing to admit just how much it hurts that they seem to exist in droves, or no one cares, or (please fuck no) I'm the only one walking around without a magic ghost in my little machine.

(I think I've shared this story before) My piano teacher, bowled over by my apparent talent and skill, excitedly comes in one day without any sheet music. Has she got some kind of fun game in store? My friendless, thirteen-year-old's eyes sparkle with anticipation. This is the thing I'm good at.
"We're going to do some improvisation today!"
The lesson ends with me in tears. She, a grown-ass woman, never really looks at me, a fresh-faced little tween with a single ball dropped, the same way again. My 'gifted' wee fingers, that can usually dance across the keys like Twigsy on crack, stiffen like a (dyspraxic in a cockpit) without written instructions. I just can't do it, I can't make things up.
I go back to mechanically playing out technically complex composers. Chopin, Lizst, Debussy.
I'm lucky to be well-supported through this laughably minor non-trauma: "but you bring such raw emotion, such rich interpretation to those pieces!" maybe they're right. But I don't care, and I don't think they should, either.

Anyway, where am I going with this? I think the point is, basically, I was wrong. I do need to do SOMETHING with SOME self-expression involved, or I'll lose my mind (I think I am losing my mind). And I don't really have the time with this stinky PhD, which has me grinding away from 8:30 to 19:00 every stinky day.
And the other point is, writing fiction, or playing music, or drawing, being creative endeavours (see: Everest) are just too damn hard for me, it takes aaages, Wiki Spice will happily whore out every droplet of time, time she absolutely does not have, for a tiny jism of approval for writing a 2000-word story. But I can crack one of THESE out in well under an hour, no approval needed.

I would just journal instead of dragging you into it, I really would, but that feels like giving up, somehow? Surely there's got to be some kind of risk involved, however mild, right?
Also, journalling sucks. I have tried it, and it fucking sucks, mate. Have you tried it? Was it the promised land?
It's not because I can't stand to write about myself (where could there possibly be shame in writing about the thing you know best?) but because I can't stand to write FOR myself.
What is the point? Are people who journal expected to look back on their old entries and laugh and cry and sigh at the cute little misgivings they used to have?
Are they meant to stand atop their old piles of scribbled nothings and see a little further than they could before?
Ew, man. No. Not for me. Not a deathbed-safe activity. It's got to be letters.

For one, I can let the pain of self-indulgence pass right through me and vanish as I pop it in the big red box, poof, gone forever, I don't own it, Zuck doesn't own it, my hubris becomes your weird cross to bear, and I get to be sort of acquiescing about the whole business.
Way more importantly than that, I'd much rather be standing on your piles of scribbled nothings than my own - then I can see something new, instead of more of the same.

I wrote to you first for a few reasons:
1. I want to chat to you more but I'm sick to the back fucking teeth of WhatsApp, it's like []
2. I was sad when you guys left, and, like a moron, it's only now I realise that when God closes a door, there's a great big fucking letterbox in the middle of it. Doy.
3. Because you, me, and Harry had that really nice chat at the pub about things that bother us, and I want more. I just want a safe, written space to talk about stuff in writing, because writing is different, you can be more honest, you can be academic, you can be lame, you can make yourself cringe, different things are funny, you don't need to speak in perfect witty brevity all the time to hold someone's attention, and on and on it goes. It's just different.
4. Unfortunately for you, Shortstraw, Harry is too well-adjusted. And poor Jambalam would cringe until his spine snapped if he had to read one of these sober - I hope the 'murican in you is powerful enough to overcome that roaringly English affectation.
Those are the only reasons I want to give you, but it's not really fair to ask for your time without giving you another - the other, better reason is: you write the best, I like to read you the most.
And I selfishly get to indulge this practice of writing, all while forcing you to produce entertaining insights in exchange for my little humdrums.

It obviously goes without saying that this is a safe space, there will be no cruel judgements of any sort and please Christ on a motherfucking Vespa NO sharing of any of the cringey contents.
Also goes without saying that the next one will be less intense; it'll all be a bit more silly and anecdotal and less grindingly personal.
But I do want to blend some grindingly personal stuff in there too, because as I say, that's the fresh exciting space that the medium creates. Mind, there's no pressure for you do hit any particular tone or content with yours - just go nuts.

If, after this wee test-run, you're actually thinking: fuck no, there is no catharsis this can offer me, who does this guy think he is, when are men going to realise that their female friends aren't there to do emotional labour (that's not what this is, I swear! I have an actual therapist!) just WhatsApp me a veto. I'll just do it with someone else - just so weirdly keen for this, I just think it'll be really fun to get letters from a friend in the mail.

I hope you're well. Not too stressed, not spread too thin. Staying well, WELL away from living within your means, dammit. Fucking the gods, tasting the rainbow.

Well, are you?

Lots of love
